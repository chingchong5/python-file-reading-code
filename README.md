# python-file-reading-code
This is a Python code that demonstrates how to read a file using Python programming language. It uses the built-in open() function to read a file and displays its content on the console. This code is a simple and useful starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to read files in Python.
This repository contains a Python script for reading and writing files. This code helps me in making my website http://nirmallottery.com where I have a lot of data to read and write. Feel free to use and modify the code to suit your needs.
