# python-file-reading-code
# open the input file for reading
with open('input_file.txt', 'r') as input_file:
    # read the data from the input file
    data = input_file.read()
    
# modify the data
modified_data = data.upper()

# open the output file for writing
with open('output_file.txt', 'w') as output_file:
    # write the modified data to the output file
    output_file.write(modified_data)


In this code, we first open the input file 'input_file.txt' for reading using the with open() statement. We then read the data from the input file using the read() method and store it in the data variable.

Next, we modify the data by converting it to uppercase using the upper() method and store the modified data in the modified_data variable.

Finally, we open the output file 'output_file.txt' for writing using the with open() statement with the 'w' mode. We then write the modified data to the output file using the write() method.


Note: Make sure to replace the file names and paths with your own input and output file names and paths as necessary.
This is a Python code that demonstrates how to read a file using Python programming language. It uses the built-in open() function to read a file and displays its content on the console. This code is a simple and useful starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to read files in Python.
This repository contains a Python script for reading and writing files. This code helps me in making my website http://nirmallottery.com where I have a lot of data to read and write. Feel free to use and modify the code to suit your needs.
